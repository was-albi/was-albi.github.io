  main-title: <strong>Hello Guest</strong>
  titleinfo: My name is Alberto, and wabisAlbi is the name I've chosen for this place. it is a word pun between the nickname I am often referred with (Albi) and the oriental concept of 侘寂 (wabi sabi). the latest is an aesthetic concept which I find remarkably fitting with my taste and with the idea behind this web site.
  scope: Welcome to my web place.<br>we may or may not know each other, but feel free to take off your shoes and walk around a bit.<br>this place is pretty new, but I plan to share here some of my thoughts. they will often be incomplete and you may find them boring or even incomprehensible. the purpose of their being here is to have a form outside my head, so they will often be adressed to few listener, sometimes just to myself. if you find some of them intriguing enough you may consider to write me a mail - I will be glad to chat with you
