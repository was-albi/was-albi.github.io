## List of interesting music

You can find the full list on my [spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/thecapitalq?si=0e9c4cd2987445b9).
You can probably find the playlist of my most recent obsessions under names such as [2022-A](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ipMpKvU09ezFb6n7Yay5R?si=bdbe73c0ea984bb0), composed by the current year and a letter. The letter is generally used to split a year into semesters (A, B), but it will probably updated in quadrimesters soon (A, B, C).
