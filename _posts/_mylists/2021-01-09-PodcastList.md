## List of my favourite podcasts

- [Many Minds](https://manyminds.libsyn.com/):
  Talks with experts (Researchers in general) about mind and its many aspects. Non particularly technical and full of unexpected topics treated in an accessible yet not superficial way. Probably my favorite podcast out there.

- [Brain Inspired](https://braininspired.co/):
  Podcast about neurosciences and related subjects, sometimes jointly with AI. The episodes are often on the technical side, but generally accessible to a broad audience too. Definitely worth if interested in the subject.

- [Fall of Civilization](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/):
  This is about past civilizations, from their glory days to their decadence. Unlike other podcasts, each episode is a "presentation" of a civilization and not an active chat. Episodes are often quite long, which can discourage the engaging, but their quality is outstanding. It also has the best intro! Definitely worth a try!

- [Tech Won't Save Us](https://techwontsave.us/):
  Podcast about the future of technology. What I love here is the critical cut on the problem, whith a lot of thoughts on political and social impacts. I am still a recent listener, but already a fan of it.

- [Lex Fridman podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/):
  Pretty interesting podcast. It fully reflects the interests of the maker, from artificial inteligence and robotics to martial arts and Russia. I do not like many episodes, but some of them are real gems instead. Take a look at nÂ° 46, 53, 74, 100!

- [Way of Ramen](https://wayoframen.com/category/podcast/):
  This is a small podcast about ramen making. Suggested only to real ramen heads.
