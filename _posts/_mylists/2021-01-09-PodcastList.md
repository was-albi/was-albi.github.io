## List of my favourite podcasts


- [Tech Won't Save Us](https://techwontsave.us/):
  Podcast about the future of technology. What I love here is the critical cut on the problem, whith a lot of thoughts on political and social impacts. Strongly recommended!

- [Team Human](https://www.teamhuman.fm/):
  Again, societal problems and technology criticism. Recommended.

- [The War on Cars](https://thewaroncars.org/):
  Urbanism and city design here, with particular focus on wellbeing of city inhabitants. Oh, didn't you know cars ruin cities?

- [Many Minds](https://manyminds.libsyn.com/):
  Talks with experts (researchers in general) about mind and its many aspects. Non particularly technical and full of unexpected topics treated in an accessible yet not superficial way. One of my favorite podcasts out there.

- [Brain Inspired](https://braininspired.co/):
  Podcast about neurosciences and related subjects, sometimes jointly with AI. The episodes are often on the technical side, but generally accessible to a broad audience too. Definitely worth if interested in the subject.

- [Fall of Civilization](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/):
  This is about past civilizations, from their glory days to their decadence. Unlike other podcasts, each episode is a "presentation" of a civilization and not an active chat. Episodes are often quite long, which can discourage the engaging, but their quality is outstanding. It also has the best intro! Definitely worth a try!

- [Way of Ramen](https://wayoframen.com/category/podcast/):
  This is a small podcast about ramen making. Suggested only to real ramen heads.
